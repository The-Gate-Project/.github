## The Gate Project

The Gate Project is an umbrella project handled by modders willing to provide technical updates to abandoned or long-forgotten mods written for the Infinity Engine games [Baldur's Gate (II), Icewind Dale (II) and Planescape Torment). The group aims to provide transparency on the updates and prevent changes to original content, to keep the mods true to their original authors.

If you have any questions regarding how your mod ended up here or else, feel free to post on [The Gate Project thread](https://github.com/orgs/The-Gate-Project/discussions) or contact 11jo/graiondilach through the Infinity Engine Discord.
