## The Gate Project

The Gate Project is an umbrella project handled by modders willing to provide technical updates to abandoned or long-forgotten mods written for the Infinity Engine games [Baldur's Gate (II), Icewind Dale (II) and Planescape Torment). The group aims to provide transparency on the updates and prevent changes to original content, to keep the mods true to their original authors.

If you have any questions regarding how your mod ended up here or else, feel free to post on [The Gate Project thread](https://github.com/orgs/The-Gate-Project/discussions) or contact 11jo/graiondilach through the Infinity Engine Discord.

### TeamBG mods :
----------------

(While waiting for news from **CoM_Solaufein** or the creation of a github for TeamBG)


- [DarkHorizons](https://github.com/The-Gate-Project/DarkHorizons) by **CoM_Solaufein**

<details>
  <summary>Here is a recap to clarify :</summary>

--- 

    There are three different branches on the Github repo :

    - The main branch which simply adds the PVRZ and BWP fixes, the safest but EE only, this version must be installed on your BGEE game (before EET if you use it).

    - The After-EET branch which include the same changes as above, and modify slightly the tp2 with %area_prefix% to allow the mod to be installed after EET and keep the BGEE compatibility (it can therefore be installed before (on BGEE) or after EET (on BG2EE), better to stick to the original one... (the main branch) but if you prefer to install the mod after EET it's possible.

    - The EE/BGT branch who attempt to add BGT compatibility and keep the BGEE (and before EET) one... @CoM_Solaufein has already done most of the work and there was not much left to do. The main quest is working and areas seem to be in orders, should be good for EE but it is mainly untested for BGT...
