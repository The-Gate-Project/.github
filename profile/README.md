## The Gate Project

The Gate Project is an umbrella project handled by modders willing to provide technical updates to abandoned or long-forgotten mods written for the Infinity Engine games [Baldur's Gate (II), Icewind Dale (II) and Planescape Torment). The group aims to provide transparency on the updates and to prevent changing of content, to keep the mods appropraite to their original writer's aims.

If you have any questions regarding how your mod ended up here, feel free to post at https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/36756-the-gate-project or contact 11jo/graiondilach through the Infinity Engine Discord.
